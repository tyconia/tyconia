# Life Cycle of the Tyconia Application & Role of Mods

Mods in Tyconia are integrated at different stages:

1. **Settings > Mods tab**: Mod management, UI modifications, and preloaded UI mods, defaults can be configured.
2. **Startup**: Preload mods affecting the UI and menu.
3. **New Game**: Enabling mods from the `Mods` tab that introduce new scenarios appear in the `Scenarios` tab.
4. **Save Games**: `Mod profiles` ensure consistency when loading on different devices per save.


## 1. Main menu

Mods in Tyconia can be downloaded and managed from the `Mods` tab in the main menu `Settings`. Here, players can:

* Enable/disable mods.
* Adjust certain default settings for their experience.
* Create and modify mod profiles.

A mod profile is quality of life feature by allowing players to easily switch between different playstyles. For example:

* A hardcore economy challenge with expensive recipes.
* A partial overhaul on top of an existing mod pack for a fresh experience.

Since mods can significantly alter the game, mod profiles are tied to save games to ensure consistency across devices by loading the same mods.

## 2. Startup

When Tyconia starts, certain mods can be preloadedâ€”these mostly affect the UI and main menu modifications. If a mod is configured to load at startup, its changes will be reflected immediately in the main menu.

## 3. New Game and Scenario Expansion

When starting a new game, mods that introduce scenarios will be listed in the `Scenarios` tab within the new game menu. Any scenario providing mods will expand the available game modes.
